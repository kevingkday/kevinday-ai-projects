# AI Applications Built by Kevin Day

This page outlines a set of real-world AI tools I’ve built and deployed, focused on insurance, education, lead generation, and conversational interfaces.

I design and code these systems myself using .NET, OpenAI, Pinecone, and related LLM infra — prioritizing production-grade workflows, not wrappers or proof-of-concepts.
